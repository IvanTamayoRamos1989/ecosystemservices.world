# ESW Cold Outreach Templates

## Template 1: Solar Developer (Regulatory Hook)

**Subject**: Your [Project Name] EIA — before it becomes a bottleneck

**Body**:

[First Name],

I noticed [Company] is developing a [X] MW solar installation in [Region/Country]. Projects of this scale typically trigger EIA requirements under [applicable regulation] — and with CSRD/ISSB reporting cycles tightening, the disclosure obligations are compounding fast.

We specialize in turning that compliance burden into a financial asset. On a recent 100ha project, we structured a biodiversity credit programme that offset 40% of the restoration CAPEX through credit pre-sales.

Two things we could help with immediately:

1. **Regulatory gap analysis** — what your current EIA is missing under the updated EU Taxonomy criteria
2. **Credit feasibility** — whether your site qualifies for carbon or biodiversity credits that could improve project IRR

Would a 20-minute call this week make sense?

## Template 2: Infrastructure / Municipal (Value Hook)

**Subject**: Turning [Project Name]'s environmental costs into revenue

**Body**:

[First Name],

Infrastructure projects in [Region] are sitting on untapped ecological value. The land you're already managing — buffer zones, drainage corridors, restored areas — can generate tradeable biodiversity and carbon credits under current EU frameworks.

At ESW, we've helped clients convert environmental mitigation costs into structured financial instruments. Our approach:

- **Quantify** the ecosystem services your project already produces
- **Certify** them under Verra, Gold Standard, or EU-aligned biodiversity credit schemes
- **Monetize** through credit sales, green bond eligibility, or sustainability-linked financing

We operate globally and adapt to local regulatory landscapes — whether EU permitting, US EPA, or emerging market frameworks — while structuring internationally recognized credit and bond instruments.

Worth a conversation?

## Template 3: Impact Investor / Fund Manager (Deal Flow Hook)

**Subject**: Screened pipeline — nature-positive projects globally

**Body**:

[First Name],

We're seeing a pattern globally: renewable energy developers are increasingly open to bolt-on biodiversity and carbon credit structures, but lack the technical capacity to design and certify them. That's creating a deal flow gap for investors with Article 9 / impact mandates.

ESW sits at that intersection. We originate, design, and structure nature-positive investment opportunities attached to real infrastructure projects — solar, wind, agri, and land restoration across [target geography].

Current pipeline includes:

- [X] ha agrivoltaic project in [Region] with carbon + biodiversity credit upside
- [X] ha degraded land restoration in [Region] with green bond structuring potential

If this aligns with your thesis, I'd welcome a brief call to share more detail.

## Template 4: Follow-Up (After No Response)

**Subject**: Re: [Original Subject]

**Body**:

[First Name],

Quick follow-up — I appreciate you're busy.

One data point that might be relevant: the latest international guidance on biodiversity credits (published [Month/Year]) is creating pricing floors for verified credits across key markets. Projects that establish baselines now will be positioned to capture early-mover premiums.

Happy to send our 2-page briefing note on this if it's useful — no call required.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Usage Notes

- **Personalize**: Always reference a specific project, region, or regulation. Generic outreach gets ignored.
- **Timing**: Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am in the target's timezone.
- **Follow-up cadence**: Day 0 → Day 4 → Day 10 → Archive.
- **Qualify before sending**: Confirm the target has an active project >10ha with environmental exposure.
- **Track everything**: Log in CRM with source, template used, and response.
