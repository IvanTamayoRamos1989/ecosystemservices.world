# ESW Outreach Templates

## Template 1: Developer / Operator (Regulatory Hook)

**Subject**: [Project Name] — EIA and disclosure alignment

**Body**:

Dear [First Name],

I am writing with reference to [Company]'s [X] MW installation in [Region/Country]. Projects of this nature and scale typically trigger EIA requirements under [applicable regulation], and the convergence with CSRD/ISSB disclosure cycles is creating compounding compliance obligations across the sector.

ESW advises developers on converting environmental compliance into structured financial instruments. In a recent engagement, we designed a biodiversity credit programme for a 100ha site that offset 40% of restoration CAPEX through credit pre-sales.

Two areas where we could add immediate value:

1. **Regulatory gap analysis** — identifying where your current EIA falls short of updated EU Taxonomy criteria
2. **Credit feasibility assessment** — determining whether your site qualifies for carbon or biodiversity credits that improve project IRR

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further at your convenience.

## Template 2: Infrastructure / Government (Value Hook)

**Subject**: Unlocking ecosystem service value in [Project Name]

**Body**:

Dear [First Name],

Infrastructure assets in [Region] hold significant unrealized ecological value. Land already under management — buffer zones, drainage corridors, restored areas — can generate tradeable biodiversity and carbon credits under established international frameworks.

ESW advises institutions on converting environmental mitigation expenditure into structured financial instruments:

- **Quantification** of ecosystem services currently produced by the asset
- **Certification** under Verra, Gold Standard, or jurisdiction-aligned biodiversity credit schemes
- **Monetization** through credit sales, green bond eligibility, or sustainability-linked financing

We operate across jurisdictions globally, structuring instruments under internationally recognized standards while adapting to local regulatory requirements.

I would welcome a brief discussion to explore whether this is relevant to your portfolio.

## Template 3: Institutional Investor / Fund Manager (Deal Flow Hook)

**Subject**: Nature-positive project pipeline — structured opportunities

**Body**:

Dear [First Name],

Across the renewable energy and land-use sectors, we are observing a consistent pattern: developers are increasingly receptive to bolt-on biodiversity and carbon credit structures, but lack the technical and financial capacity to design and certify them. This is creating a deal flow gap for investors with Article 9 or impact mandates.

ESW operates at that intersection. We originate, design, and structure nature-positive investment opportunities attached to real infrastructure — solar, wind, agri, and land restoration across [target geography].

Current pipeline includes:

- [X] ha agrivoltaic project in [Region] with carbon and biodiversity credit upside
- [X] ha degraded land restoration in [Region] with green bond structuring potential

Should this align with your investment thesis, I would welcome a brief call to discuss further.

## Template 4: Follow-Up (No Response)

**Subject**: Re: [Original Subject]

**Body**:

Dear [First Name],

Following up briefly on my previous note.

One development that may be relevant: the latest international guidance on biodiversity credits (published [Month/Year]) is establishing pricing floors for verified credits across key markets. Projects that secure baselines now will be positioned to capture early-mover premiums as these markets mature.

I am happy to share our briefing note on this topic — no call required.

Regards,
[Your Name]

## Usage Notes

- **Personalize**: Always reference a specific project, jurisdiction, or regulation. Generic outreach is disqualifying.
- **Timing**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am in the target's timezone.
- **Follow-up cadence**: Day 0 → Day 4 → Day 10 → Archive.
- **Qualification threshold**: Active project >10ha with environmental or disclosure exposure.
- **CRM discipline**: Log every interaction — source, template variant, response status.
- **Tone**: Professional, concise, substantive. No exclamation marks. No sales language. Lead with insight, not with the firm.
