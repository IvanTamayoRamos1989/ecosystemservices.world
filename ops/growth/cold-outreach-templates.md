# ESW Cold Outreach Templates

## Template 1: Solar Developer (Regulatory Hook)

**Subject**: Your [Project Name] EIA — before it becomes a bottleneck

**Body**:

[First Name],

I noticed [Company] is developing a [X] MW solar installation in [Region]. Projects of this scale in [Province] typically trigger Article 7 EIA requirements under Ley 21/2013 — and with the new CSRD reporting cycle starting, the disclosure obligations are about to compound.

We specialize in turning that compliance burden into a financial asset. For a recent 100ha project in Extremadura, we structured a biodiversity credit programme that offset 40% of the restoration CAPEX through credit pre-sales.

Two things we could help with immediately:

1. **Regulatory gap analysis** — what your current EIA is missing under the updated EU Taxonomy criteria
2. **Credit feasibility** — whether your site qualifies for carbon or biodiversity credits that could improve project IRR

Would a 20-minute call this week make sense?

## Template 2: Infrastructure / Municipal (Value Hook)

**Subject**: Turning [Project Name]'s environmental costs into revenue

**Body**:

[First Name],

Infrastructure projects in [Region] are sitting on untapped ecological value. The land you're already managing — buffer zones, drainage corridors, restored areas — can generate tradeable biodiversity and carbon credits under current EU frameworks.

At ESW, we've helped clients convert environmental mitigation costs into structured financial instruments. Our approach:

- **Quantify** the ecosystem services your project already produces
- **Certify** them under Verra, Gold Standard, or EU-aligned biodiversity credit schemes
- **Monetize** through credit sales, green bond eligibility, or sustainability-linked financing

We work exclusively in Spain and Southern Europe, so we know the regulatory landscape intimately — from DIA/AAU permitting to TNFD alignment.

Worth a conversation?

## Template 3: Impact Investor / Fund Manager (Deal Flow Hook)

**Subject**: Screened pipeline — nature-positive projects in Iberia

**Body**:

[First Name],

We're seeing a pattern: renewable energy developers in Spain are increasingly open to bolt-on biodiversity and carbon credit structures, but lack the technical capacity to design and certify them. That's creating a deal flow gap for investors with Article 9 / impact mandates.

ESW sits at that intersection. We originate, design, and structure nature-positive investment opportunities attached to real infrastructure projects — solar, wind, agri, and land restoration across Iberia.

Current pipeline includes:

- [X] ha agrivoltaic project in [Region] with carbon + biodiversity credit upside
- [X] ha degraded land restoration in [Region] with green bond structuring potential

If this aligns with your thesis, I'd welcome a brief call to share more detail.

## Template 4: Follow-Up (After No Response)

**Subject**: Re: [Original Subject]

**Body**:

[First Name],

Quick follow-up — I appreciate you're busy.

One data point that might be relevant: the European Commission's latest Biodiversity Credit guidance (published [Month/Year]) is creating a pricing floor for verified credits in Southern Europe. Projects that establish baselines now will be positioned to capture early-mover premiums.

Happy to send our 2-page briefing note on this if it's useful — no call required.

Best,
[Your Name]
