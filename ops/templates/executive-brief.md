## 2. Ecological Baseline

### Key Findings
- **Habitats identified**: _(e.g., Mediterranean scrubland, riparian corridors)_
- **Species of concern**: _(e.g., Iberian Lynx — Critically Endangered, Great Bustard — Vulnerable)_
- **Regulatory constraints**: _(e.g., Natura 2000 buffer zone, EIA Art. 7 triggers)_

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Feasibility |

## 3. Regenerative Strategy

### Mitigation Hierarchy Applied
1. **Avoid**: _(e.g., Relocate panels from nesting corridor)_
2. **Minimize**: _(e.g., Construction windows outside breeding season)_
3. **Restore**: _(e.g., Native seed mix on disturbed areas)_
4. **Offset**: _(e.g., Biodiversity credits for residual impact)_
