## Phase 1: BRIEFING (Project Controller)

### Project: I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Nashville (Davidson County) to Murfreesboro (Rutherford County), Tennessee, USA |
| **Corridor** | I-24, I-40, I-440 — approximately 18 centerline miles (Phase 1) + 8 miles (Southern Extension) |
| **Project Type** | Managed toll lanes (Choice Lanes) — highway infrastructure P3 concession |
| **Client** | Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) |
| **Jurisdiction** | United States — Federal (FHWA, NEPA, TIFIA, USACE §404) + State of Tennessee (TMA 2023) |
| **Biome** | Temperate deciduous — Cumberland Plateau / Nashville Basin transition |
| **Contract Structure** | Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain (DBFOM), up to 50-year concession |
| **Estimated Scale** | >$1B construction value; $250M public subsidy identified; TIFIA + PABs financing |
| **Procurement Stage** | RFQ issued Nov 2024; SOQs due Jan 2025; Concession Agreement target Jul 2026 |
| **Classification** | Advisory — Environmental & Ecological Services for P3 Respondent Team |

### ESW Role Assessment

ESW would NOT be a primary Respondent (we are not a construction/engineering firm). ESW's opportunity is to:
1. **Join a Respondent team** as a specialist environmental/ecological subconsultant
2. **Provide EIA, NEPA compliance, ecological baseline, and mitigation/restoration advisory** services
3. **Structure biodiversity/carbon credit potential** for any ecological offsets required
4. **Advise on TNFD/sustainability reporting** for the concessionaire entity

### Key Data Points for Assessment
- NEPA Environmental Assessment in progress, draft expected March 2025
- Aquatic Resource Alteration Permit and USACE §404 permit initiated
- 9 crossings over active CSX rail tracks at 5 locations
- Utility impacts: electric (TVA, NES, MTE), gas (Atmos, Colonial, Enbridge, Piedmont, TC Energy), water/sewer
- Stormwater management infrastructure required
- Noise barriers required
- Bridge replacements (6 existing bridges over I-24 + 6 roadway bridges over I-24)
- Environmental coordination complexity: high (urban corridor, multiple waterways, Mill Creek)
- Ineligible firms: Jacobs, HNTB, CDM Smith, Barge Design, S&ME (conflicted — they prepared the RFQ/NEPA)

**Question to the Board**: Should ESW pursue this opportunity as an ecological/environmental subconsultant on a Respondent team?

## Phase 2: DEPARTMENT ASSESSMENTS

---

### Eco-Scientist — Board Assessment

**Subject**: I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes — Ecological feasibility and ESW scope

**Rating**: GREEN

**Key findings**:
- The project traverses the Nashville Basin / Cumberland Plateau transition zone — a temperate deciduous biome with moderate-to-high ecological sensitivity. Mill Creek and associated tributaries are confirmed aquatic features requiring USACE §404 and state ARAP permitting.
- NEPA Environmental Assessment is underway but incomplete (draft March 2025). This creates a window for ESW to contribute ecological baseline data, habitat surveys, and impact analysis to a Respondent team that needs to demonstrate environmental competence in its SOQ.
- The corridor crosses multiple waterways requiring aquatic resource permits, involves stormwater management design, and requires noise mitigation — all areas where ecological expertise adds direct value to a bid team.
- Species of concern in the Nashville Basin include Indiana bat (*Myotis sodalis*, federally endangered), Nashville crayfish (*Orconectes shoupi*, federally endangered, endemic to Mill Creek basin), and various state-listed mussel species. Any team lacking ecological depth will be exposed.
- Key competitor firms with relevant ecological expertise (Jacobs, CDM Smith, S&ME, HNTB) are **ineligible** due to organizational conflicts of interest. This significantly reduces the pool of available environmental subconsultants.

**Risks**:
- ESW has limited track record in US federal NEPA process specifically (severity: MEDIUM). Mitigated by partnering with a US-based NEPA specialist or hiring a senior NEPA practitioner.
- Tennessee-specific species data (Nashville crayfish, cave-obligate fauna) requires local ecological knowledge (severity: LOW-MEDIUM).

**Recommendation**: Proceed with conditions

**Conditions**:
- Secure a US-based NEPA compliance partner or senior hire with FHWA Environmental Assessment experience.
- Confirm access to Tennessee-specific ecological databases (TDEC, TWRA heritage data, NatureServe).

### Regen-Architect — Board Assessment

**Subject**: I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes — Technical solution viability for ESW scope

**Rating**: AMBER

**Key findings**:
- The primary scope is highway construction, not ecological restoration. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are peripheral — limited to stormwater management, riparian buffer zones along Mill Creek crossings, noise barrier greening, and potential pollinator habitat along right-of-way margins.
- The mitigation hierarchy applies: the EA process will identify unavoidable impacts (aquatic habitat, tree canopy, wetlands) requiring compensatory mitigation. ESW can design mitigation/restoration packages that exceed minimum requirements — creating differentiation for the bid team.
- Agrivoltaic or large-scale regenerative design is not applicable here. The NbS scope is constrained to corridor-scale interventions: bioswales, constructed wetlands for stormwater, riparian restoration, and ecological connectivity features (wildlife crossings at Mill Creek).
- Value proposition is strongest in Phase 7 (Implementation & Monitoring) of the 50-year concession — long-term ecological monitoring, adaptive management, and potential biodiversity credit generation from mitigation sites.

**Risks**:
- Limited NbS scope relative to ESW's core offerings — this is a civil infrastructure project, not a regenerative landscape project (severity: LOW). ESW's role would be supporting, not leading.
- Design integration depends on the Lead Designer's willingness to incorporate ecological design features (severity: MEDIUM).

**Recommendation**: Proceed with conditions

**Conditions**:
- Position ESW's scope around mitigation design, ecological monitoring, and long-term concession-period environmental management rather than primary NbS design.
- Ensure engagement terms allow ESW to participate in design reviews where ecological input is relevant.

### GIS Analyst — Board Assessment

**Subject**: I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes — Spatial data availability and constraints

**Rating**: GREEN

**Key findings**:
- Spatial data infrastructure for Tennessee is robust. Key available datasets: USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD), National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), FEMA flood maps, TDEC water quality data, USDA SSURGO soils data, EPA NEPAssist environmental screening tool.
- TDOT has committed to providing Reference Information Documents including a Google Earth (.kmz) conceptual design file, traffic data, and environmental technical reports. This reduces the data acquisition burden.
- Mill Creek watershed mapping, USACE-jurisdictional waters delineation, and stormwater drainage modeling are well within standard GIS capabilities. Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 provide free multispectral imagery for land cover change analysis.
- The corridor is approximately 26 miles (18 + 8 extension), urban-suburban, with complete LiDAR coverage from USGS 3DEP. Terrain modeling and viewshed analysis (for noise barrier placement) are straightforward.

**Risks**:
- TDOT proprietary data (detailed utility mapping, right-of-way parcels, ITS infrastructure) may only be available to Shortlisted Proposers post-RFQ (severity: LOW).

**Recommendation**: Proceed

**Conditions**: None. Data availability is not a constraint for ESW's participation.

### Green Financier — Board Assessment

**Subject**: I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes — Financial viability and ESW value proposition

**Rating**: GREEN

**Key findings**:
- This is a >$1B DBFOM toll concession with TIFIA credit assistance and Private Activity Bonds (PABs) — a mainstream US P3 financial structure. The $250M public subsidy from TDOT's 10-Year Plan de-risks the project. Revenue source is dynamic user fees from managed lanes, a proven model in US toll markets (I-495/I-95 Virginia, I-635 Texas, I-77 North Carolina).
- ESW's financial contribution to a Respondent team would focus on: (a) quantifying biodiversity/carbon credit potential from compensatory mitigation sites, (b) structuring ecological value into the concessionaire's sustainability reporting, and (c) advising on EU Taxonomy / TNFD alignment if the equity investors are European infrastructure funds (common in US P3 market — Cintra, Meridiam, Plenary, DIF, etc.).
- Several major P3 equity investors are increasingly required to report under CSRD/TNFD. A Respondent team that includes ESW can demonstrate ESG integration to differentiate its SOQ — particularly in the "Project Delivery Narrative" evaluation criteria (Section 5.3.2) which weights understanding of scope, risk, and long-term life-cycle management.
- The SOQ evaluation awards 400 of 1,000 points for financial qualifications. ESW's role does not directly impact this, but our sustainability finance advisory strengthens the overall narrative.

**Risks**:
- Carbon/biodiversity credit revenue from highway corridor mitigation sites is modest — this is not a standalone green finance opportunity (severity: LOW).
- ESW's fees as a subconsultant would be a fraction of the overall project budget (severity: LOW — but must be commercially viable).

**Recommendation**: Proceed

**Conditions**:
- Fee structure must justify the engagement. Target a retainer for SOQ/RFP support + a long-term ecological monitoring and advisory contract for the 50-year concession period.

### Legal Compliance — Board Assessment

**Subject**: I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes — Regulatory landscape and legal risk

**Rating**: GREEN

**Key findings**:
- **Applicable regulatory framework**: NEPA (42 U.S.C. §4321 et seq.), Clean Water Act §404 (USACE permit), Tennessee Water Quality Control Act (ARAP/§401), Endangered Species Act §7 consultation (USFWS), FHWA Federal-Aid Highway Program requirements, Tennessee Transportation Modernization Act 2023 (TMA).
- NEPA is the critical path environmental requirement. The EA is being prepared by TDOT (with conflicted firms Jacobs, HNTB, CDM Smith). A NEPA decision by FHWA is expected June 2025. ESW would not be involved in NEPA document preparation (conflict-free) but could provide ecological technical reports that feed into the EA or post-EA design refinements.
- Section 404/ARAP permits have been initiated by TDOT for the conceptual design. The Developer (concessionaire) will be responsible for all other permits and modifications. ESW can support permit application preparation, particularly biological assessments and aquatic habitat surveys.
- DBE (Disadvantaged Business Enterprise) requirements apply under 49 CFR Part 26. ESW's participation may contribute to DBE goals depending on certification status and jurisdiction.
- The 50-year concession creates long-term environmental compliance obligations (stormwater permit maintenance, endangered species monitoring, mitigation site stewardship). This is where ESW's value is most durable.

**Risks**:
- ESW must ensure it has no organizational conflict of interest per RFQ Section 6.3. Given that ESW has not been involved in TDOT's NEPA or RFQ preparation, no conflict exists (severity: NEGLIGIBLE).
- Tennessee-specific environmental permitting requires familiarity with TDEC and TWRA procedures (severity: LOW).

**Recommendation**: Proceed

**Conditions**:
- Confirm ESW has no direct or indirect relationships with any of the 13 ineligible firms listed in Section 6.3.
- Engage Tennessee-licensed environmental professionals as required for state permit applications.

### Growth Hacker — Board Assessment

**Subject**: I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes — Market positioning and pipeline impact

**Rating**: GREEN

**Key findings**:
- The US P3 managed lanes market is one of the most active infrastructure procurement pipelines globally. Major upcoming projects: I-24 (TN), I-35 (TX), I-10 (TX), Gateway Tunnel (NY/NJ), Capital Beltway (VA). Establishing ESW's presence on one team positions us for follow-on opportunities across the US P3 market.
- **Competitive landscape**: With Jacobs, CDM Smith, HNTB, S&ME, and Barge Design all ineligible due to conflict, there is a significant gap in the ecological/environmental subconsultant market for this specific procurement. Remaining Respondent teams need qualified environmental partners.
- **Target Respondent teams**: The likely shortlisted teams will be led by major P3 developers (Cintra/Ferrovial, Meridiam, Plenary, ACS/Dragados, Acciona, Macquarie, John Laing) paired with large contractors (Kiewit, Walsh, Lane, Flatiron, Granite). ESW should approach the lead developers directly — several are European firms with existing ESG/TNFD reporting obligations.
- **Pipeline value**: A-score lead. This is a named procurement with a defined timeline, identified decision-makers, and a clear ESW value proposition. Pursuit cost is moderate (SOQ contribution + relationship building).

**Risks**:
- ESW has no established US P3 track record — cold outreach may face skepticism without a US reference project (severity: MEDIUM). Mitigated by partnering with an established US environmental firm.

**Recommendation**: Proceed

**Conditions**:
- Identify and approach 2-3 Respondent teams within 30 days (procurement timeline is aggressive — SOQs due Jan 2025).
- Lead with ESW's European infrastructure fund relationships and TNFD/CSRD advisory capability as the differentiator.

### Brand Voice — Board Assessment

**Subject**: I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes — Reputational fit and content opportunity

**Rating**: GREEN

**Key findings**:
- A US P3 managed lanes project is fully aligned with ESW's positioning as the global authority on ecosystem services for large-scale projects. Highway infrastructure is a core client sector.
- Content opportunities: (a) case study on integrating ecological services into P3 highway concessions, (b) white paper on long-term environmental stewardship in 50-year concession models, (c) LinkedIn campaign targeting P3 equity investors and developers on TNFD implications for infrastructure portfolios.
- The project profile is high-visibility: TDOT's first P3 under the new Transportation Modernization Act, Nashville's highest-profile infrastructure investment. Association with the winning team generates significant brand equity.
- Tone alignment: The RFQ language is institutional, technical, and federal-compliance oriented. ESW's corporate tone matches perfectly. No startup language, no comparisons to other firms.

**Risks**:
- If ESW joins a team that is not shortlisted or not selected, there is no reputational downside — participation in SOQ is confidential per RFQ Section 6.1 (severity: NEGLIGIBLE).

**Recommendation**: Proceed

**Conditions**: None.

## Phase 3: SYNTHESIS (Project Controller)

## ESW Board Summary

**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Subject**: Should ESW pursue the I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes (TDOT P32401) as an ecological/environmental subconsultant?
**Called by**: CEO

### Consensus

All seven agents rate this opportunity GREEN or AMBER (no RED ratings). Unanimous positions:

1. **ESW should pursue this opportunity.** The I-24 Southeast Choice Lanes represents a legitimate entry point into the US P3 infrastructure market.
2. **ESW's role is as a subconsultant, not a Respondent.** ESW would provide ecological assessment, environmental compliance support, mitigation design, sustainability advisory (TNFD/CSRD), and long-term ecological monitoring services to a Respondent team.
3. **The conflict-of-interest exclusion list creates a market gap.** Five major environmental/engineering firms (Jacobs, CDM Smith, HNTB, S&ME, Barge Design) are ineligible. Respondent teams need qualified ecological partners.
4. **The 50-year concession is the real value.** Short-term SOQ/RFP support generates moderate fees. The long-term ecological monitoring, permit compliance, and mitigation site stewardship contract over a 50-year concession is where ESW creates durable revenue.
5. **ESW's European infrastructure fund relationships are a differentiator.** Major P3 equity investors (Cintra/Ferrovial, Meridiam, DIF, Plenary) face CSRD/TNFD reporting obligations. ESW's advisory on sustainability disclosure is directly relevant to their investment committees.

### Contested

1. **Scope of NbS opportunity**: Regen-Architect rates AMBER, noting that NbS scope is limited to corridor-scale interventions (bioswales, riparian buffers, stormwater wetlands) rather than ESW's typical large-scale regenerative projects. Other agents rate GREEN, viewing the limited NbS scope as acceptable given the market access value. **Resolution**: Accept that NbS is supporting, not leading — position ESW's scope around ecological compliance and long-term monitoring rather than primary regenerative design.

### Open Questions

1. **US NEPA experience**: Does ESW currently have personnel with direct FHWA NEPA Environmental Assessment experience? If not, what is the timeline and cost to acquire this capability (hire or partnership)?
2. **Fee viability**: What is the estimated fee range for an environmental subconsultant on a US P3 SOQ/RFP, and what is the potential value of a 50-year ecological monitoring contract? Green Financier to model.
3. **Tennessee-specific licensing**: Are there Tennessee state licensing requirements for environmental consulting that ESW must satisfy? Legal Compliance to confirm.
4. **DBE certification**: Is ESW eligible for DBE certification under 49 CFR Part 26? If so, this would significantly increase ESW's attractiveness to Respondent teams (DBE participation goals will be mandated).

### Decision

**PROCEED** — ESW should pursue this opportunity as an ecological and environmental advisory subconsultant on a Respondent team.

### Conditions

1. ESW must secure US NEPA compliance capability (partnership or hire) before approaching Respondent teams.
2. ESW must confirm no organizational conflict of interest per RFQ Section 6.3.
3. ESW must identify and approach at least 2 target Respondent teams, prioritizing European-headquartered P3 developers with CSRD/TNFD reporting obligations.
4. Fee structure must include both (a) SOQ/RFP support retainer and (b) long-term concession-period ecological services contract.
5. ESW must engage Tennessee-licensed environmental professionals for state-specific permitting requirements.
