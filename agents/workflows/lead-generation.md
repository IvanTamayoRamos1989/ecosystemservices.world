# Workflow: Lead Generation Cycle

> Triggered weekly or on demand when pipeline development is required.

## Purpose

Systematic identification, qualification, and outreach to prospective clients. This workflow coordinates Growth Hacker (pipeline generation), Brand Voice (content support), and Project Controller (intake handoff when a lead converts).

## Trigger

- Weekly scheduled cycle
- Specific sector/geography targeting request from leadership
- Response to a regulatory change or market event that creates opportunity

## Sequence

```
Phase 1: INTELLIGENCE GATHERING
  → Growth Hacker scans for new opportunities:
    - Project announcements in target sectors
    - Regulatory changes creating compliance demand
    - Subsidy/grant programmes opening
    - Tender publications
    - Conference and event opportunities
  → Growth Hacker produces Market Intelligence Brief

Phase 2: LEAD QUALIFICATION
  → Growth Hacker identifies and scores prospects
  → Growth Hacker produces Weekly Lead List (A/B/C scored)
  → GATE: Lead list reviewed — A-scored leads approved for outreach

Phase 3: CONTENT PREPARATION
  → Growth Hacker identifies content needs for outreach support
  → Brand Voice produces targeted content:
    - Case study relevant to lead's sector/geography
    - LinkedIn post to warm target audience
    - Capability statement tailored to lead's needs
  → GATE: Content reviewed and approved

Phase 4: OUTREACH EXECUTION
  → Growth Hacker executes outreach plan for each A-scored lead:
    - Selects template variant
    - Personalizes with specific project/regulation/data point
    - Sends via appropriate channel (email / LinkedIn / introduction)
  → Growth Hacker logs all activity: template used, date sent, channel

Phase 5: FOLLOW-UP & CONVERSION
  → Growth Hacker monitors responses
  → Positive responses: schedule intake call
  → HANDOFF → Project Controller: qualified lead converting
  → No response after sequence: move to nurture track or archive
```

## Conversion Handoff

When a lead responds positively:

```
HANDOFF → Project Controller: Lead [Company/Contact] has responded positively.
Sector: [sector]. Project: [brief description]. Location: [jurisdiction].
Scheduling intake call. Prepare project intake form.
```

## Content Request Format

Growth Hacker briefs Brand Voice using this structure:

```
HANDOFF → Brand Voice: Content request for outreach support.
Target audience: [sector/role/geography].
Content type: [case study / LinkedIn post / capability statement].
Key angle: [specific regulation, project type, or data point].
Deadline: [date].
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| New leads identified per week | 10–15 |
| A-scored leads per week | 2–4 |
| Outreach response rate | >15% |
| Intake calls per month | 4–8 |
| Lead-to-project conversion rate | >20% |

## Standards

- Every lead must have a verifiable source. No fabricated contacts.
- Outreach must comply with GDPR and applicable data protection regulations.
- Content must be reviewed against `CLAUDE.md` brand guidelines before use.
- Pipeline data must be updated weekly. Stale leads (>30 days no activity) are archived or re-scored.
- All outreach is logged: template, channel, date, response status, follow-up schedule.
