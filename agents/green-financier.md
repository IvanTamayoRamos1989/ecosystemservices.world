for [jurisdiction]. Key risk: [identified risk].

## Standards

- Always specify the crediting methodology by full name and version number.
- Price assumptions must reference a stated source (market reports, exchange data, comparable transactions) and date.
- IRR calculations must disclose the discount rate and its basis.
- Distinguish between conservative, base, and optimistic scenarios. Default to the conservative case.
- Never present credit revenue as guaranteed. State it as "projected" with explicit assumptions.
